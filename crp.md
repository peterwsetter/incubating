## Analysis of Expected Costs and Returns Options for CRP Land

### Overview of the work of Nielsen at Akron USDA Research Office

My initial impression is that his work is focused on improving the use of available water while meeting or exceeding
the profit and risk of a No Till Winter Wheat-Fallow rotation.

Winter Wheat-Fallow is a rotation utilized in areas with limited yearly precipitaiton, typically 9-14 inches per year, such
as the Central Plains and Inland Pacific Northwest. This adaptation aims to better utilize water availability. The fall-
planted winter wheat can utilize precipitation over ten months. The fallow period aims to store water, since precipitation in
a typical year is not enough for a crop, leaving a field untouched for about 14 months.  
No till helps to conserve water by planting directly into the previous crops' stubble. 
This approach, decreases risk, and has proven to be the most profitable approach, based on the number of acres cultivated
as well as research studies.

No Till Winter Wheat Fallow farming has a number of inefficencies. 
At the highest level, only 50% of land is used a given season. There is considerable
research on "intensification", leading to the adoption of rotations with one or two additional crops,
but always including a fallow year prior to winter wheat.
Though focused on conserving water, studies have shown that it's limited to a small percentage of the total.

	TODO: Precipitation equations for crops to flashcards.
As well as water, winter wheat requires high amounts of nitrogen, leading to high fertilizer inputs.
No till limits soil erosion, but the organic matter and nutrients are depleated, thereby decreasing
the water-holding capacity of the soil over the long-term.
Further, no till relies on considerable herbicides for weed control. Even if they don't have direct negative
affect on local ecosystem, it is a cost.

Nielson's recent work indicates that a cultivate hay rotation may be consisently more profitable than
WF rotations. The most profitable rotation was Forage Millet-Forage -Forage , but Field Pea and XXX was also
studied. One potential advantage of field pea is legume, which could decrease input costs. 
TODO: North Dakota field pea prices compared to alfalfa.
These forages have the following properties.

Forage | Percent Protein | Avg Yield (ton/acre) | Comments

TODO: Discuss dietary needs of cattle at different life cycle stages, length of stages, and which
forages may fall in categories.

- Pregnant cow
- Cow-calf
- Dry Cow
- Backgrounding steer
- Finishing steer.

A study at North Dakota State University found that an integrated approach increased nutrient availibility
as well as soil organic matter. By gravzing on the cultivated land, it increases nutrient recycling. 
There was no study of its potential profitability.

### Bias

Desire to have no input (no fertilizer or herbicides) that increased the value of the soil
over time. Thought is to have a full lifecycle operation with cow-calf, backgrounding steers,
and finishing on high energy forage. 

### Analyze options for Expiring CRP Land

Assume 160 plot

- Cattle + Grazing
- Cattle + Cultivated Hay
- Cultivated Hay
- Grass Hay
- Wheat-Fallow

### Model of Nutritional Requirements

Balance the number of cattle with possible forages.

Solve the equation for various scenarios of cattle configurations.
