## YouForecast

Ask volunteers to forecast who they think will win the election in their state.

- Do everyday people have an accurate sense of the political climate in their state? 
- If asked to predict the outcome of an election, is the aggregate prediction well-calibrated?

Rather than ask who a person is planning on voting for, ask them to predict who will win the popular vote in their state or district. 

Ideally, two questions:

1. How likely is it that CANDIDATE will win the popular vote in STATE/DISTRICT? {0,100}
2. What is your forecast based on?

Ask participants if they would like to make a prediction in the future.
